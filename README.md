# A simple Weeping Angels mod to use with Adventures in Time or whatever mod your heart desires! But remember, don't blink.

### Angels will creep up on you from the forests and caves in the Overworld, and from (almost) anywhere in the Nether and the End. You can easily outpace them, but where there is one angel, there will be another - don't blink, and don't turn your back. They will teleport you and feed off of your life force.
